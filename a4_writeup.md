# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

The most difficult part of this assignment for me was actually not the class implementation and was instead writing more tests!
Nothing in the class was really new or too challenging for me, but coming up with the ideas and writing the tests was just really boring and difficult (to come up with/implement useful tests) at times.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

I'm sure it would be relatively simple (after a lot of thinking) to make an algorithm that chooses the best move.
However, I don't think I could come up with this on my own, and I also think that it would be pretty funny to train a sort of "AI" on a bunch of games of tic tac toe. It wouldn't be too hard considering how simple the game is, and I don't think you'd need a huge amount of data of winning moves/losing moves to make a decent computer player.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

If my aforementioned approach is to be taken, more training data would likely result in better (best?) moves.
